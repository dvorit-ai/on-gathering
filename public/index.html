					Don't worry, this website isn't broken! 
					<br><br>

					On-Gathering is a website that unfolds only through collective presence. Inspired by Mindy Seu’s essay, which explores co-authorship and the idea that relationships between things are a form of authorship, this site reflects that belief: you can only access the full text when enough people are here to reveal it. Alone, you’ll only glimpse fragments.
					<br><br>

					Alongside the essay, sourced vintage images of plant specimens remind us that the gathering—of words, ideas, and food—is an act of survival, nourishment, and connection.

				I have long been a gatherer. Though we rarely hear this word used literally anymore, we do hear its sister <em class="user-7">gathering</em>, as in gathering people, gathering information, gathering pace. Occasionally—increasingly, through a year of pandemic—we hear of gathering mushrooms and wild-foraged bouquets,

Created to “raise questions about ethnobotany and interspecies collaboration,” the arrangements were foraged from Wretched Flowers’s property in Connecticut. As the year went on and we all began to navigate life in a time of heightened precarity, Anna Tsing’s 2015 The Mushroom at the End of the World grew increasingly relevant. See Anna Lowenhaupt Tsing, The Mushroom at the End of the World: On the Possibility of Life in Capitalist Ruins (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2015).">1</span> 
				hobbies for the otherwise domesticated. But the term <em class="user-7">gatherer</em> we more immediately associate with our origins as hunter-gatherers, nomads foraging food and moving with the seasons for subsistence. We went, we gathered goods, and then we returned home to our kin, <em class="user-7">sharing as survival.</em>
				<br><br>
				In Ursula K. Le Guin’s <em class="user-7">Carrier Bag Theory of Fiction</em> <span class="citation citation-popup user-4 " data-text="Ursula K. Le Guin, The Carrier Bag Theory of Fiction, rev. ed. (London: Ignota Press, 2019).">2</span> (1986), Le Guin posits the first human tool as the basket, not the spear, thereby recasting the first protagonist as a gatherer, not a hunter. Not only did this address the deeply gendered roles of these two parts, it also changed the singular hero to the plural collective, from  <em class="user-7">he</em> to <em class="user-7">we.</em> “<span class="user-8">Before the tool that forces energy outward,</span>” she writes, “<span class="user-8">we made the tool that brings energy home.</span>” Gathering, for Le Guin, is not a masculine, techno-utopian process of disruption or of moving fast and breaking things, but the methodical, deep labor that comes from “<span class="user-8">looking around, rather than looking ahead,</span>” from gathering rather than hunting.<span class="citation citation-popup user-4 " data-text="The positioning of Le Guin’s basket and Tsing’s feral infrastructure is foundational to The Scalability Project, which also uses this line in its curatorial statement.

				When I call myself a gatherer, I mean that, even without my hands in dirt, I aggregate, together with collaborators, disparate pieces from an ecosystem, and develop the appropriate container for each collection.

				Gathering is, in this way, not the act of aggregation alone. It is not an automated collection or the formal acquisition of works for an institution, nor is it the plundering or extraction of resources from a neighboring region. It is the tender and thoughtful collection of goods for your kin, and a moment for reunion, for celebration, and for introspection around those goods. Now, as I reflect on some of the many remote conversations I’ve had in the past year, I see a throughline of gathering in its many forms: the material gathering of crowd-sourced ephemera; the social gathering of sharing these findings in online conversations; and the collective building of digital tools to contain them. Gathered here, in this text, these expansions and explorations of what gathering is and what it can be might help us return to the original meaning of the word, sharing as survival, as we move from physical to virtual contexts.

The index holds examples of hackerspaces, digital-rights activist groups, DIWO (Do-It-With-Others) organizations, DIY (Do-It-Yourself) teledildonics manuals, bio-hacktivists, data dominatrixes, and open-source estrogen pioneers. Like the <em class="user-7">NWSC</em>, the <em class="user-7">Cyberfeminism Index</em> too began as a bibliography—inspired, secondhand, by a claim Kirsten’s advisor at Barnard made that revolution cannot not happen within an institution; Kirsten and Susan, the advisor said, needed to go grassroots.

				In an interview with Roxana Fabius, Patricia M. Hernandez, and me for <em class="user-7">The Scalability Project</em> (2020), adrienne maree brown described relationships like a spiderweb—diaphanous yet strong, thick yet porous. “<span class="user-8">A web allows things to fall through, like a sieve,</span>” she said. “<span class="user-8">Some things are not meant to be caught.</span>” I like to think of these webs as citational networks; who you read allows you to catch similar sentiments. brown also built upon Audre Lorde’s “<span class="user-8">The Master’s Tools Will Never Dismantle the Master’s House</span>” (1984), declaring, “<span class="user-8">I believe conversation is not a master’s tool. I believe being in a circle, in a community, is not a master’s tool.</span>” Here, she describes gathering people to share stories as a web, a network, as a finding aid for like-minded voices. <span class="citation citation-popup user-4 " data-text="adrienne maree brown, “Conversation Is Not a Master’s Tool,” interview by Roxana Fabius, Patricia M.

A technologist, artist, and host of <em class="user-7">Wampum Codes</em>, Amelia interviews Indigenous people who work with new technologies in what she labels “<span class="user-8">co-creation through a podcast.</span>” As a member of the Seneca-Cayuga Nation of Oklahoma in the Haudenosaunee (Iroquois Confederacy), Amelia told me in a conversation for <em class="user-7">DataBrowser</em> that she was taught to think about storytelling from a decentralized perspective. Stories are entrusted to storytellers by the elders. But these storytellers are not meant to repeat the narrative verbatim; they are expected to understand these stories and, through them, reflect on what the community needs to hear at any given moment. This temporal gathering, both in and around a story, acknowledges the personal subjectivities always inherent in retelling. Only multi-authorship truly exists.

				Memory work of this sort is also a form of activism. Whose memories are saved and retold to future generations? Hailey Loman, the co-creator, along with her interviewers and storytellers, of the Autonomous Oral History Group (AOHG), spoke with me about the collective gathering of stories. “<span class="user-8">You’re taking a lived experience and making a record of it together,</span>” Loman said. There is a “<span class="user-8">sweet duty</span>” to shaping someone’s personal memories. Oral histories, like publications, bind people. After a conversation, all parties maintain ownership of what transpired, and they continue to hold ties to one another. This form of storytelling is not predetermined, but develops through its unfolding. Perhaps gathering stories is radical because it refuses to give the gatherer all of the credit. The collector-collection dynamic is deliberately broken. The person who puts it together is only one of many parts.
				<br><br>

				Though seemingly intimate, these aforementioned conversations were held remotely through a myriad of video-conferencing tools that have become so familiar in pandemic times. And while the frequency of online correspondence has increased, the platforms of these new social gatherings have affordances, affecting behaviors of those who use them. Since the start of the pandemic, Prem Krishnamurthy has led <em class="user-7">Present!</em> an experimental Zoom talk show and performance series that tries to activate all of the different modes of dialogue that might exist on one given digital platform. <span class="citation citation-popup user-4 " data-text="Present! is an experimental Zoom talk show and performance series that Prem Krishnamurthy began in March 2020. For documentation of the first three seasons, see Prem Krishnamurthy, “Present!,” 2020, https://bit.ly/PresentExclamation.">16</span> In early February 2021, I attended Prem’s latest workshop and conversation, co-led by Kalaija Mallery, called “<span class="user-8">A Gathering of Gatherings,</span>” around new formats of online convening. We discussed sociologist Ray Oldenburg’s concept of the “<span class="user-8">third place,</span>” the space between home and work, and whether this place could exist online. The event began with rules for conduct and an "<a href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb38def81-2a5d-4081-8c5d-f8adbf900251_960x540.png" target="_blank" class="user-8">incomplete list of suggestions for organizing communities online.</a>" <em class="user-7">Present!</em> feels like a feedback loop, adapting suggestions from the audience into the live event and then commenting on its output. After Kalaija pointed out the lack of white noise that often creates the ambience for most online events, everyone unmuted. When we keep our microphones off and stage our conversations as a singular broadcast between hosts and viewers, we lose moments for participation. Consider the eeriness of seeing everyone laugh but hearing silence. Once everyone unmuted, we shed our formality and the casual conversation returned, with the many moments of interruption that permeate in-person gatherings.

				These rules of engagement, for conduct and for play, created what Priya Parker calls “<span class="user-8">temporary alternative worlds,</span>” in <em class="user-7">The Art of Gathering</em> (2018), which was recommended to me by Laurel Schwulst. The primary goal of meaningful social gatherings, or, as Priya writes, “<span class="user-8">the conscious bringing together of people for a reason,</span>” is to create a “<span class="user-8">sense of belonging.</span>” <span class="citation citation-popup user-4 " data-text="During the Spring 2021 semester, Laurel Schwulst taught the Princeton course Graphic Design: Link while I led the Yale MFA course On Gathering. We co-developed the virtual gathering prompt that takes place in the second of half of each class, for which Laurel recommended Priya Parker, The Art of Gathering: How We Meet and Why It Matters, (New York: Riverhead Books, 2018). For our online class syllabi, see Laurel Schwulst, Graphic Design: Link, Princeton University, 2021, https://veryinteractive.net/link/ and Mindy Seu, On Gathering, Yale University, 2021, http://on-gathering.com/.">17</span> On remote conferencing platforms, we’re limited to very particular frames and senses, so if we want to connect with people, we actually have to learn new skills. In the process, we might embrace “<span class="user-8">bumpiness,</span>” Prem’s term for “<span class="user-8">pleasure in the irregular, in what’s not already expected and familiar.</span>” In the end, as Prem’s longtime colleague Chris Wu stated, “<span class="user-8">It’s not about perfection. It’s all about the gesture.</span>”
				<br><br>

				Gathered here, we weave from cyberfeminist indexes to citational networks and from oral histories to conversational, online events. As we continue to learn our way with these digital tools and online events, we might shift our energy from trying to prevent inevitable technical difficulties to cultivating a sense of belonging. Tools break and containers change, but the urge to tell stories remains. Containers and content can be used to mutually inform the shape of their counterparts, expressing a tender, anti-heroic, communal, and present side of storytelling in place of our received understanding of historical material as heroic, individual, disconnected, and past. As we complicate the definition of gathering, this blurring of container and content diminishes any lingering idea of fixed, solitary authorship. After all, societal movements come not from singular authors but emerge as dissolved collections, making it impossible to know where one thing begins or ends. To survive, we gather not only from what’s around us, but from among us.<br><br>

Images are sourced from the RISD Fleet Library Special Collections Library to accompany the original text, comparing and contrasting the relationship between gathering ideas and people to the nourishment and femininity that comes from gathering food, embodying the ideas that "<span class="user-8">sharing is survival</span>" and "<span class="user-8">building relationships between things is a form of authorship.</span>"
